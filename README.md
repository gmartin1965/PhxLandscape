## Admin Mode

- Dashboard UI
  - Map (Toggle Between Assets and Properties)
    - The idea is that this will be a Card on the UI that will show a map of the service area for the company. Two toggles...
      - Assets View will show the bubbles indicating where all of the Assets tracked by the company are located. Trucks, Trailers, Heavy Equipment, Mowers, etc.
      - Properties View will show bubbles indicating where all of the Properties are located. These are the Properties the company performs work for.

      - Open Alert Count
  - KPI Section (Key Performance Indicators)
    - Number of Crews
      - This may be some indication of the Number of Crews working today / Number of Crews the company has defined. The goal would be something in the high 90's I would imagine. Not sure about this one.

## Crew Mode

- Crew Track will ultimately be a native "mobile application" rather than a responsive web site.</br></br>
- Vehicle Selection - the User must tell the application which Vehicle he is driving today.
  - A pick list seems appropriate.
    - The list will show the last 3 Vehicles the User was driving
    - A mechanism will be provided that will allow a search if the Vehicle is not among the last 3 driven by that User
    - Once Login and Vehicle Selection is complete, the User will then see the Dashboard.</br></br>
- Dashboard
  - Banner for Unresolved Alerts
  - Listing of Today's Route
    - This will be a List that shows the Properties this Crew is expected to work today. The list will be retrieved by sending Today's Date and the user_id of the logged in user as params.</br></br>
- Alert Manager
  - User can see a listing of Alerts (Descending by Date)
    - Toggle for "Unresolved, Resolved, All"
  - Most likely, the Alerts feature will be a Header/Detail database relationship. Each Alert will be a Header row and the back and forth conversation to resolve the Alert will make up the Detail rows.
  - Question: Will Alerts be attached to Customers, Properties, Areas, Assets, etc.? Or, will they simply be assigned to Drivers?
    - Best approach may be to attach the Alert to the Customers, Properties, Areas, Assets, etc. And, also to a Driver. If a Driver is covering for another Driver, and he rolls up to Property 123 and that Property has an Alert, he should see it. Even if he is not the "normal" Driver. Or, if a Vehicle is due for an Inspection or needs to come back to the Maintenance Warehouse for whatever reason, any Driver in that Vehicle needs to see the Alert until it is resolved.</br></br>
- Work Order
  - Listing of Work Orders
    - User can toggle between Open/Closed/All
    - Initial Criteria for the list is all work orders that are associated with Properties that are part of a Route owned by this Driver ID.
    - Search Feature
      - Possibly, keep it simple says maybe not. Because the Criteria is very limiting to begin with, adding UI complexity of search may not be best idea.
  - Work Orders will also appear in the Drill Down when a User starts to "work" a Property on the Route. This is more a listing of all of this Driver's Work Orders.</br></br>
- Crew List
  - List of all Crew Members
    - Meant to provide the Driver with a quick glance of who the members of his team are.
    - Also provides photos of team members and phone numbers.
